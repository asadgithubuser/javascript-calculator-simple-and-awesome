### Listening to key-presses
Five things can happen when a person gets hold of a calculator. They can hit:
- a number key (0–9)
- an operator key (+, -, ×, ÷)
- the decimal key
- the equals key
- the clear key



If the calculator shows a non-zero number, we want to
append the clicked key to the displayed number. To append a number, we concatenate a string.
